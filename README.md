# Kottans-backend courses

## Git
It was simple enough, it would be cool to add a test to see if a student knows the team to be shown in the course, and to give them the opportunity to skip if the answers to the tests are correct.

## Unix Shell
It was a very useful lesson! Special symbol to match characters and path to the home directory.

## GitHub & Collaboration
So far so good. Pull request is a very useful command, here I trained to put it into practice, also learned how to give branch prefix, like "bugfix-login-form".

Node.js is a very powerful tool right out of the box.
Completed tasks were very important because they were previously asked at interviews or given in test tasks.
