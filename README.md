# Kottans-backend courses

## Git
It was simple enough, it would be cool to add a test to see if a student knows the team to be shown in the course, and to give them the opportunity to skip if the answers to the tests are correct.

## Unix Shell
It was a very useful lesson! Special symbol to match characters and path to the home directory.
